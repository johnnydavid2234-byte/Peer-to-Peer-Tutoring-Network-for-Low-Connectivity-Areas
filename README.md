# Peer-to-Peer-Tutoring-Network-for-Low-Connectivity-Areas# 📚 Peer-to-Peer Tutoring Network for Low-Connectivity Areas

Welcome to a decentralized solution for education in underserved regions! This Web3 project uses smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer tutoring networks, enabling reliable matching, scheduling, and payments even in areas with intermittent internet. By leveraging blockchain's immutability and offline-capable apps (with delayed syncing), it empowers local communities to share knowledge without relying on centralized platforms.

## ✨ Features

🔗 Decentralized user registration and profiles for tutors and students  
🤝 Automated matching of tutors to student requests based on subjects and availability  
📅 Session scheduling with confirmation and reminders  
💰 Secure escrow payments in STX or custom tokens, released upon completion  
⭐ Reputation system with ratings and reviews to build trust  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism for fair outcomes  
🌐 Offline-first design: Interactions can be queued locally and synced when connectivity returns  
🚫 Anti-fraud measures to prevent fake profiles or sessions  
📊 Analytics for community growth and impact tracking  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project addresses the real-world problem of limited access to education in low-connectivity zones (e.g., rural areas or developing regions) by creating a resilient P2P network. Users interact via a mobile app that works offline, batching transactions for blockchain submission when online. The system involves 8 smart contracts written in Clarity to handle various aspects securely and transparently.

**For Students**  
- Register via UserRegistry and create a request in StudentRequest with your needs.  
- The MatchingEngine suggests tutors; select one and schedule via SessionManager.  
- Pay into PaymentEscrow upfront. After the session, confirm completion to release funds and leave a rating in ReputationTracker.  

**For Tutors**  
- Register and build your profile in TutorProfile.  
- Browse or get matched to requests via MatchingEngine.  
- Confirm sessions in SessionManager, conduct the tutoring (offline if needed), and claim payment from escrow.  
- Build your reputation through positive reviews.  

**Handling Low Connectivity**  
- App stores actions locally (e.g., session confirmations as signed messages).  
- When online, batches are submitted to the blockchain for immutable recording.  
- Disputes can be raised offline and resolved once synced.  

This setup ensures education flows even without constant internet, fostering community-driven learning while using blockchain for trust and accountability. Get started by deploying the Clarity contracts on Stacks!
